    "description": "hiPathia is a web tool for the interpretation of the consequences of the combined changes of gene expression levels and/or genomic mutations in the context of signalling pathways. hiPathia transforms uninformative gene expression and/or genomic variation data into signalling circuit activities, which carry information on the different cell functionalities triggered by them. Such signalling activities not only account for the underlying molecular mechanisms of diseases or the mode of action of drugs but they can also be used as mechanistic features for the prediction of complex phenotypes.",
